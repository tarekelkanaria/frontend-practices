# Hangman game

<font color="#283593">

- The game consists of two sections, on the right side all the English letters, and on the left side an empty board. At the bottom, there are squares with _the same number of letters in the required word_.
- the game is about **guessing** the right letters to construct the required word.
- in the **up-right corner**, _you'll find the category that the required word is from_.
- if you made a wrong guess the hangman drawing will start to **display** on the left side, depending on _the number of wrong attempts the drawing will be complete_ then **the game is over**.
